This program will simulate a day-to-day simulation of running a store. This program will allow the user to manage products, employees, and finances to maximise daily profits whilst avoiding bankruptcy.

The purpose of the program is to offer users a simplified, hands-on understanding of the intricacies involved in running a retail store, whilst being engaging at the same time. The audience of the program may range from students who want to pursue courses in business to people who have commute or have short periods of downtime/ free time during the day.

The user will be interacting with the terminal of the compiler which will prompt the user for a variety of options. For example, the program will prompt the user to enter how many items they will purchase, or the program will prompt the user to enter a number to navigate different sections of the menu.

By using the terminal for user interaction, the user can refer to previous inputs/outputs to decide their next action. The program will also provide error messages whenever the user has inputted an invalid value. For example, when purchasing items, the user may enter a negative value. If this does occur, the program will be able to recognize this error and print out an error message to prompt the user to input a valid value.

The program will allow the user to investigate the store inventory to visualize the different items they have in stock to help them decide which items they need to purchase before starting the next day.
