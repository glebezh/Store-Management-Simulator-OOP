This program will simulate a day-to-day simulation of running a store.

This program will allow the user to manage products, employees, and finances to maximise daily profits whilst avoiding bankruptcy.

The purpose of the program is to offer users a simplified, hands-on understanding of the intricacies involved in running a retail store, whilst being engaging at the same time.

The audience of the program may range from students who want to pursue courses in business to people who have commute or have short periods of downtime/ free time during the day.
